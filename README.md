SalesorBid is an e-auction platform an online marketplace where users can buy and sell items through a bidding process. Sellers list their products, set starting prices, and interested buyers place bids. The highest bidder wins the item when the auction ends. These platforms often include features like product categorization, detailed product pages, and search filters for efficient browsing.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
